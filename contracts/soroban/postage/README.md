# Postage Contract

Records sender-authorized token escrow for Stealth messages and tracks whether
each escrow is pending, expired, disputed, settled, refunded, or reclaimed.

The contract is initialized with one accepted SEP-41/Stellar Asset Contract
asset, a minimum postage amount, a treasury address, and an explicit fee in
basis points, a fixed expiry duration, and an optional dispute duration.
`submit` transfers the full postage amount from the sender into the contract
address and fixes the absolute expiry timestamps on the record. `settle`
transfers net postage to the recipient and fee to treasury. `refund` returns
the full escrow to the sender. `reclaim` lets the sender recover unresolved
escrow after expiry and any dispute window.

## Interface

- `initialize(asset, treasury, minimum, fee_bps, expiry_seconds, dispute_seconds)` sets accepted asset, fee, expiry, and dispute policy once.
- `config()` reads the accepted asset, treasury, minimum, and fee policy.
- `minimum()` reads the configured minimum postage.
- `quote(sender_trusted)` returns zero for trusted senders or the minimum.
- `configure_guard(guard)` binds the lifecycle guard contract once.
- `guard()` returns the configured guard address.
- `submit(...)` escrows sender-authorized postage for a message.
- `expire(message_id)` marks unresolved postage expired at its fixed expiry boundary.
- `settle(message_id)` lets the recipient accept the postage and releases escrow.
- `refund(message_id)` lets the recipient return escrow to the sender.
- `dispute(message_id)` lets the recipient move expired pending postage into the bounded dispute state when dispute seconds are configured.
- `reclaim(message_id)` lets the sender reclaim unresolved postage at the fixed reclaim boundary.
- `get(message_id)` reads the current record.

## Settlement Invariants

- Only the configured asset is accepted.
- Fee policy is explicit and bounded to `0..=10000` basis points.
- Expiry and dispute deadlines are fixed at submission.
- Reclaim fails before the fixed reclaim boundary.
- A message can move from pending, expired, or disputed to exactly one terminal state: settled, refunded, or reclaimed.
- Terminal states cannot transition.
- Balance conservation is tested across sender, recipient, treasury, and contract escrow balances.

## Contract Spec Regeneration Check

`spec.json` feeds `scripts/generate-contract-bindings.mjs`, which emits the
typed TypeScript client in `src/services/stellar/contracts/postage.ts`. If the
contract interface changes without regenerating `spec.json`, the bindings
silently drift from on-chain reality.

The `spec_check` tests in `src/lib.rs` prevent that drift:

- `spec_json_matches_contract_interface` decodes the XDR spec entries that the
  soroban-sdk macros embed in the crate — the same entries a wasm build
  publishes in its `contractspecv0` section — renders the canonical
  `spec.json`, and fails if the committed file differs (whitespace-insensitive).
- `spec_covers_every_public_contract_function` scans the contract source for
  `pub fn` declarations and fails if any function is missing a spec entry, so
  a new function cannot slip past the check.

After an interface change, regenerate and verify with:

```sh
cd contracts/soroban
UPDATE_SPEC=1 cargo test -p stealth-postage spec_json   # rewrites spec.json
cargo test -p stealth-postage                            # verifies
node ../../scripts/generate-contract-bindings.mjs        # refreshes TS bindings
```

Struct fields in `spec.json` are alphabetized because the on-chain XDR spec
sorts map keys; declaration order in Rust does not affect the ledger contract.
