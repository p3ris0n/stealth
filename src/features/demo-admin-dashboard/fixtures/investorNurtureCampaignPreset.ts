 * Campaign Preset: Investor Nurture
 *

 * quarterly updates, follow-up prompts, report attachments, and reply
 * requests. It is designed to populate the dashboard with data for testing
 * investor-facing communication flows including postage, proofs, and
 * attachment delivery.
 *
 * All data is fake, deterministic, and safe for public repository review.
 * This is Campaign issue 16 of 50 for the Demo Admin Dashboard initiative.
