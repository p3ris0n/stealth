## How to Use These Docs

### Reading Documentation

1. Start with what you need:
   - **Development setup** → [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)
   - **API reference** → [API.md](./API.md)
   - **Contributing** → [../CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md](../CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md)
   - **Architecture** → [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)

2. Follow the links for deeper context

3. Check code examples and patterns

### Contributing to Documentation

When updating docs:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add links between related docs
- Keep docs up-to-date with code changes
- Document new APIs immediately

## Guidelines

- ✅ Keep docs in sync with code
- ✅ Include practical examples
- ✅ Link between related topics
- ✅ Document constraints clearly
- ✅ Explain the "why" not just "what"

- ❌ Don't document main app in this folder
- ❌ Don't include copy-paste from main app docs
- ❌ Don't leave docs stale
