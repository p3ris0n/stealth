# Meeting Assignment Tool

Assign meeting responsibilities to team members based on skills, workload, and capacity.

## Ownership Boundary

All work for this tool must stay inside:

```
tools/v2/team/meeting-assignment-tool/
```

Do not wire this tool into the main app, routing, inbox architecture, wallet core, Stellar core, database schema, or existing design system unless a future integration issue explicitly allows it.

## Structure

```
fixtures/           Deterministic local data (team members, sample meetings)
services/           Core pure-function logic + async service factory
tests/              node:test suite (no external runner required)
docs/               Review notes and contributor context
types.ts            All domain types
index.ts            Folder-local public API
```

## Run Tests

```bash
node --test tools/v2/team/meeting-assignment-tool/tests/meeting-assignment.test.mjs
```

17 tests, no external dependencies.

## Public API

```ts
import { assignMeetings, createMeetingAssignmentService } from "./index";

// Pure function — deterministic, synchronous
const result = assignMeetings({ teamMembers, meetings });
// result.assignments[]  — per-meeting assignment with reason
// result.summary        — totals, coverage %, per-member effort delta

// Async service wrapper — simulates delay/failure for UI dev
const svc = createMeetingAssignmentService({ simulateDelay: false });
const data = await svc.assign();
```

## Assignment Algorithm

1. Sort meetings by priority (desc), then effort (asc).
2. Find members whose skill set covers all `requiredSkills`.
3. Filter by remaining capacity (`weeklyCapacity − currentLoad ≥ effort`).
4. Pick the least-loaded eligible member; ties broken by higher capacity.
5. Unassigned reason is one of: `"matched"` / `"capacity"` / `"skill_mismatch"`.
